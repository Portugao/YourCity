# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

0. If the application's root folder does not contain a `vendor/` folder yet, run `composer install --no-dev` to install dependencies.
1. Copy MUYourCityModule into your `modules` directory. Afterwards you should have a folder named `modules/MU/YourCityModule/Resources`.
2. Initialize and activate MUYourCityModule in the extensions administration.
3. Move or copy the directory `Resources/userdata/MUYourCityModule/` to `/userdata/MUYourCityModule/`.
   Note this step is optional as the install process can create these folders, too.
4. Make the directory `/userdata/MUYourCityModule/` writable including all sub folders.
